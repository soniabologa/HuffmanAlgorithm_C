# Huffman-algorithm

# Project Title
Huffman algorithm in C

# Project Description
This program uses the Huffman algorithm to both encode and decode text. The project was completed in the Spring of 2023, as part of my Data Organization course, CS241, taught by Brooke Chenoweth at the University of New Mexico. Professor Chenoweth provided project guidelines, lectures on the algorithm, and test files for encoding and decoding.

# How to install and run the program
Download the files in the scr folder. The project can then be run from the command line, using the makefile, and adding the text files to be encoded or decoded as command line arguments.
